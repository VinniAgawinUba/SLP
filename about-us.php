                                        of the teaching methodology to achieve the learning objectives of a course or subject. The students‚Äô engagements 
                                        are based on needs expressed by partner communities by which they can possibly offer solutions and new perspectives

                                        The faculty is expected to craft rubrics for each area visit/work to assess how the learning objectives are achieved 
                                        as the students progress in their engagement. Service learning components such as area work performance, final SL 
                                        outputs, presentation of SL outputs to partner community, summative reflection, attendance during the processing 
                                        session, are also integrated in the grading matrix.
